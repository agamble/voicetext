## How to run

Add your OpenAI API key to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. The easiest way to do this is to set it in your `.env` file in the root of the repository.

Then you can run the server with:

```ruby
bundle install
./bin/dev
```

You can then navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
